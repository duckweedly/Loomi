# Specification Quality Checklist: M25 MCP Management + LSP Read-only Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details that constrain non-technical requirements beyond necessary safety boundaries
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic where possible
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No unnecessary implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- M25 deliberately keeps MCP management read-only and LSP bounded/read-only. Writable MCP config, remote MCP/OAuth, full language-server lifecycle, and browser/web/artifact runtime are later features.
