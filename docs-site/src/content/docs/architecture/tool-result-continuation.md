title: Tool Result Continuation
description: Minimal model continuation boundary after an approved tool result.
---

Tool result continuation is the M7 slice after approval-gated tool execution. It lets Loomi take a redacted `tool_call_succeeded` result, feed it back to the configured model provider, and persist one final assistant answer in the same run.

The current implementation adds the continuation boundary without adding new tool families. The only supported tool remains `runtime.get_current_time`, and continuation allows only one tool call and one follow-up model request per run.

## Context source

Continuation context is built from existing conversation messages plus the current run's persisted events:

1. Load thread messages through the user message that triggered the run.
2. Find the matching `tool_call_requested` event.
3. Find the matching `tool_call_succeeded` event.
4. Build one provider-neutral assistant tool-call item.
5. Build one provider-neutral tool-result item from the redacted result metadata.

No durable `messages.role = tool` row is written for this slice. Run events and the tool-call projection remain the audit source of truth.

## Provider boundary

Runtime code uses provider-neutral message roles:

| Role | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `assistant_tool_call` | The model's prior request for the allowlisted tool. |
| `tool_result` | The redacted result returned to the model. |

OpenAI-compatible providers serialize those items as an assistant message with `tool_calls` followed by a `tool` message with the same `tool_call_id`. Other provider families can adapt the same neutral shape later without changing product data.

## Event flow

The success path reuses the existing run-event stream:

```text
model_request_started       model_phase=initial
model_output_delta*         model_phase=initial
tool_call_requested
tool_call_approval_required
tool_call_approved
tool_call_executing
tool_call_succeeded
model_request_started       model_phase=continuation
model_output_delta*         model_phase=continuation
model_output_completed      model_phase=continuation
run_completed
```

History-first SSE remains unchanged. The second model phase is just another ordered set of persisted run events.

## Loop limit

Continuation does not support another tool call. If the continuation provider asks for any tool, Loomi records `unsupported_tool_loop` and fails the run. This keeps M7 to one approved tool execution and avoids introducing a multi-step agent loop before the UI, safety policy, and worker state are ready.

## Draft behavior

Frontend replay treats a successful tool event as a pause point for an existing assistant draft. When continuation deltas arrive with `model_phase = continuation`, the visible draft starts from the continuation answer and finalizes once. This prevents pre-tool text from becoming a duplicate final assistant message.

## Safety boundary

Only redacted result metadata is eligible for provider continuation. Tool result context must not include raw provider payloads, raw executor internals, credentials, file contents, shell output, arbitrary network responses, or hidden local state.

Approved `runtime.get_current_time` worker execution now calls continuation immediately after `tool_call_succeeded`. Denied and `tool_call_failed` runs are terminal and never re-enter the model. If the continuation provider fails, Loomi records one redacted failed terminal state and does not persist a final assistant message.
